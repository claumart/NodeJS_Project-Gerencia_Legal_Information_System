# Legal Documents Information System

## Introduction
In this project I built an Information System for the management of Legal Documents, this is a web application that has its own database and works based on user roles. 
The project is already discontinued since the first version of the platform was delivered to the company, nevertheless, the project is open to continued enhancements.

## Software Architecture
### Database
The database used for this application is a MySQL database,
you can see the whole architecture of the database by opening the Modelo-BD-GSL.mwb file _(You need to install MySQLWorkbench to open the file)_
You can also generate the database from this file _(SQL commands)_

### Software
The application was written in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, using NodeJS as the environment for running the application,
therefore you need to install NodeJS and the dependencies specified in the _package.json_ file

## Bugs and Improvements
Based on the development phase these are some of the improvements that can be made:
- Apply buffering to the upload of images to the system
- Implement a more secure way of login rather than using the website cookies variables
